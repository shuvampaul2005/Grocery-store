# Grocery-store
The main aim of this project is to provide all the grocery products to the customers remotely from their homes/work place and also to help the local grocery store owners in the growth of their business. During this pandemic, the people are unable to go to the general grocery stores and hence the grocery store owners require an online portal to take orders. The customer can order Product online and see his orders. Thus, this is a digital way of management of the Product order and also the payment system.
